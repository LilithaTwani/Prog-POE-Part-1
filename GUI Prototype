## GUI Prototype 
The GUI prototype for the CMCS is available in the image folder

Added XAML mockups for the CMCS prototype:

- Login Window: role selection for (Lecturer, Coordinator, Manager) with email and password.
- Lecturer Window: submit new claims, upload supporting documents, view claim status.
- Coordinator Window: view and verify pending claims.
- Manager Window: view verified claims and approve/reject them.
- It is a visual design only, and there is no functionality yet.
